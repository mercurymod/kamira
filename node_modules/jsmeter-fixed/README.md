jsmeter-fixed
=============

Fixes the `start()` bug in Noah Peters' jsmeter project, which you can find
here:

http://code.google.com/p/jsmeter/

There are no plans to actually maintain or develop this fork, I created it
purely to have a jsmeter npm module that actually works and doesn't add a bunch
of other stuff I don't want or need.
